*ThothLabs*

**ThothLabs IMPORTANT NOTES**:
- The Project Is Still Under Development

**ThothLabs Project Overview:**
*ThothLabs* is an educational software platform designed to enhance learning in astronomy and space science. Our core project, an interactive Orrery Web Application, provides a dynamic visualization of the Inner Solar System with a special focus on Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) such as asteroids and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs).

*This initiative is part of our participation in the **NASA Space Apps Hackathon**, where we aim to create an engaging, scientifically accurate learning tool for students, educators, and space enthusiasts. The project aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 4: Quality Education), aiming to make astronomy education more interactive and accessible.*

**ThothLabs Key Features:**
- **Educational 3D Solar System Model**: Using **Three.js** and **Tween.js**, our interactive model enables users to explore planetary orbits and NEO trajectories, enhancing their understanding of celestial mechanics.
- **Modern Frontend Design**: Built with **React.js** and **Bootstrap v5**, the user interface ensures smooth navigation and a visually engaging experience.
- **Backend System & Data Management**: A robust backend powered by **Express.js** and **Node.js**, with a **MySQL database** for managing scientific data and user interactions.
- **Scientific Contributions**: Our research extends beyond software, with **three scientific research papers and an abstract** covering:
  - The Inner Solar System
  - Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)
  - Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs)
- **Integrated Learning Resources**: ThothLabs acts as an educational academy, offering research materials, interactive tools, and workshops to support learning in astronomy.

**ThothLabs Tools & Technologies:**
- **Frontend**: React.js, Bootstrap v5, Three.js, Tween.js
- **Backend**: Express.js, Node.js
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Design & UI/UX**: Canva
- **API Testing**: Postman
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub

**ThothLabs Future Development:**
As we continue refining ThothLabs, our future plans include:
- Expanding scientific datasets and improving real-time simulations.
- Enhancing educational content, including interactive courses and real-time astronomical event tracking.
- Developing collaborative features for researchers, students, and educators to share insights and discoveries.

**ThothLabs Vision:**
ThothLabs is dedicated to **bridging technology and education** to foster a deeper understanding of our solar system and the impact of Near-Earth Objects. By offering an immersive, interactive experience, we strive to make space science more engaging and accessible, while also contributing to global initiatives in education and research.
